In this study, a RAG pipeline was created that allows for Q&A sessions using financial PDF documents in limited environments (e.g., desktop computers).
The Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model was used in 4bit quantization mode.
The documents were embedded using the Colpali model and uploaded to the Qdrant vector database.
